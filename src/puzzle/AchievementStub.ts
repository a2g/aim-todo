/**
 * #### So this is NOT a piece, its just the thing that pieces attach to.
 * BUT it inherits from PieceBase, so it can participate in this hierarchical
 * operation where a piece removes itself from the piece's parent. And since
 * this AchievementStub is a pieces parent, it needs to derive form that class.
 *
 * Some parents have multiple children, so the PieceBAse has provision for this
 * but this AchievementStub can only ever have a single one. So we have these getters
 * and setters for GetTheAchievementWord, and GetThePiece - that make the code easier to
 * read because they reinforce that this only has one of those.
 *
 * This has solved and validated flags because this thing gets a tree added to it,
 * until it is solved, and additionally if all the pieces can be removed then
 * its validated. So zero pieces could be - initial state, or solved and validated.
 * And half a tree could be solved, and half validated Or have solved. So to make
 * it clear we have these flags.
 *
 * This is also where command steps that pertain to event are kept. Once we have
 * validated an order of achievement solving, then the most single minded way to do it
 * would be to do the steps required of ament1, then the steps required of achievement2.
 * The solution could be thousands of permutations that adhere to this,
 * but its handy to have a predictable deterministic solution - at least as a
 * starting point, before optimizations.
