/**
 * This started out simpler that PileOfPieces, because there
 * was only ever one piece that outputted a particular achievement.
 * But then - and probably obvious in hindsight - it was changed to handle
 * multiple pieces that can output a achievement, hence a map of arrays.
 * Oh , and a strange difference - this one contains RootPiece
 * rather than piece. RootPiece just wraps a Piece and adds a
 * cached version of 'firstNullInput' <-- why can't we just calculate?
 * yeah, that seems dodgy and subject to bugs.
 * Jan'24 - now that RootPiece has the ordered list of commands, its more
 * justifiable to have the concept of RootPiece.
